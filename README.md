## 🎯 Recommendations Section

| Risk Level | Suggested Action | Purpose |
|-------------|------------------|----------|
| 🔴 **High Risk (≥ 0.7)** | Offer discount, personal support call, or onboarding review | Retain top-value at-risk users |
| 🟡 **Medium Risk (0.4–0.7)** | Send feature tutorials or re-engagement campaigns | Improve feature adoption |
| 🟢 **Low Risk (< 0.4)** | Upsell or referral programs | Reinforce loyalty & advocacy |

Each customer segment includes metrics on total revenue, average churn rate, and NPS correlation.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

**Input Fields:**
`customer_id`, `monthly_revenue`, `days_since_signup`, `last_login_days_ago`,  
`logins_last30days`, `active_features_used`, `tickets_opened`, `NPS_score`,  
`plan_type`, `payment_status`

**Outputs:**
- `churn_probability` → Float (0–1)
- `revenue_at_risk` → Float (USD)
- `risk_category` → "Low", "Medium", "High"
- `top_factors` → List of top churn drivers
- `recommendation` → Text instruction per user

## 🧮 Model Performance

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|--------|-----------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| **XGBoost** | 0.915 | 0.834 | 0.824 | 0.829 |
| **Random Forest** | 0.918 | 0.842 | 0.824 | 0.833 |

Both models were trained on 100K SaaS customer records using an 80/20 stratified split to maintain class balance.
